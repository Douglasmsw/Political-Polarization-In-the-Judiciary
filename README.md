# Political Polarization In the Federal Judiciary

In the wake of the Supreme Court reproductive rights opinion leak I was curious to see if the political polarization we hear so much about
in discussions about the US congress applied to the judicial branch of governemnt.

Simply put: *Is there ideological polarization in congress? If so, does it have an effect on partisanship in the judicial branch?* 

This question is important because the judicial branch is supposed to act as a third party that reviews executive and legislative rulings that are tainted 
by partisanship from an objective view grounded in legal literature. But we know judges all have partisan leanings that affect their rulings. If politicians
are appointing more ideologically polarized judges this trickles down into the case law and decisions that rule the land. *This goes against the very 
design of the judicial branch*. 

*A write-up of my methods and findings can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Douglasmsw/Political-Polarization-In-the-Judiciary/blob/main/Judge_Polarization_Report.pdf"><strong>"Judge_Polarization_Report"</strong></a> document.* 

I did my data exploration using a Jupyter notebook, so my code file is messy, broken into blocks, and is not organized into neat functions as a normal 
coding project would be.

The data I used is from the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (https://data.stanford.edu/dime)
and the Voteview Nominate dataset (https://voteview.com/data)

They're both fascinating datasets that I reccomend playing around with!

I hope you find the report interesting and it sparks some curiosity. I limited myself to six pages so there is are 
a lot of questions and rabbit holes left unexplored in this quick project, but I'm hoping to return to this
and also see more academic inquiry into this area!
